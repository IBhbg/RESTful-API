# Servlet base RESTful-API
## Background
The is a RESTful API Servlet based. It uses CRUD operations. It has some methods at basic level.
Those methods are used in ProductServlet class. Those methods are optimized in optimizeapp. The app class is to check how much energy those methods consume (wihtout any optimization) when running with a Java agent. 
Write ... More work needs to be done on this project
## How to build
Install maven on your machine. I use a Linux distro. Take a look at the pom file. Download and install [jRAPL](https://github.com/aservet1/jRAPL). Download and install [Java Microbench Harness](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh), JMH. It is poosible to add JMH from Plugins. You need to install the Java Agent called [joularjx](https://github.com/joular/joularjx). If you are interested in the application to see if those methods works then download [Apache Tomacat](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) and configure your settings. I got error when I ran my Java Agent. The error came from IntelliJ. I have an older version from InteLLiJ and it worked. 


## Running
Before running a benchmark you have to run:
```
sudo modprobe msr
```
### The command below is for benchmarking:`
```
sudo java -cp "target/rest-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/WEB-INF/classes:target/rest-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/WEB-INF/lib/*:/home/superman/Skrivbord/h√∂st2023/jRAPL-master/src/java/target/jRAPL-1.0.jar" com.demo.optimizeapp
```
### The benchmark starts
![start](https://github.com/IBhbg/RESTful-API/blob/main/images/.b/start.png)
###
### The benchmark stops  
![stop](https://github.com/IBhbg/RESTful-API/blob/main/images/.b/End.png)

Java agent:
```
sudo java -javaagent:/home/superman/Skrivbord/joularjx-develop/install/joularjx-2.8.1.jar -cp "/home/superman/Skrivbord/RESTful-API/target/classes" com.demo.app

```

## Code
The following shows my benchmark method designs. I have added more line of code in my project.
```
@Benchmark
public void addProduct(){
  SyncEnergyMonitor m = new SyncEnergyMonitor();
  m.activate();
  EnergyStats before = m.getSample();
  doWork(); // the code you want to benchmark
  EnergyStats after = m.getSample();
  EnergyDiff diff = EnergyDiff.between(before, after);
  m.deactivate();
}
